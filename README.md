## Project Name:

This is a project named Chubby, created by team Weight A Minute. Its developer is Jamal Chubb. 

## Project Description

This app is going to be designed to keep track of how many calories you are burning throughout the day given each exercise you are partaking in. Exercises may include walking, running, weight-lifting, biking, swimming, hiking, playing sports, etc. I want to build this application because it can be hard to keep track of how many calories you are burning if you aren't on a treadmill or stairmaster. Being able to log how many minutes you are doing an exercise while having the application calculate the total amount of calories burned will be an insurmountable benefit for people who are actively trying to lose weight or even maintain their body weight. First it will ask you how much you currently weigh and how tall you are. Once you input your weight and height, it will tell you how many calories you can consume for the day. Then based on the exercises you complete for the day your calorie intake will increase. For example if I weigh 250lbs and measure as 6'3, my daily calorie intake would be about 2400 calories to maintain my weight with zero exercise. However if I run around the track for 30 minutes, my calorie intake would increase to around 2600-2700 for the day.

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
